Contributing
------------

We love contributions! These guidelines will help make sure we can get your
contributions merged as quickly as possible:

1. Write `good commit messages`__!
2. If you want to add a new feature, talk to us on the `mailing list`__ or
   `IRC`__ first. We might already have plans, or be able to offer some advice.
3. Make sure your code passes the tests that ImageKit already has. To run the
   tests, use ``make test``. This will let you know about any errors or style
   issues.
4. While we're talking about tests, creating new ones for your code makes it
   much easier for us to merge your code quickly. ImageKit uses nose_, so
   writing tests is painless. Check out `ours`__ for examples.
5. It's a good idea to do your work in a branch; that way, you can work on more
   than one contribution at a time without making them interdependent.
