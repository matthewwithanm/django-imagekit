If the vcgt tags are loaded into the video LUTs, the brightness of the monitor will abruptly change. If a profile is loaded that has no vcgt tag, you can see if the video LUT is left alone or if some default curve is loaded instead.These profiles are probably more useful in a relative sense than in an absolute sense. By that I mean you may compare behavior (video LUT, OS color handling, application color handling, etc.) with one profile loaded vs. a different profile loaded. This will help you discover which parts of the profile are being used by different parts of your computer system. This particular set of profiles allows you to vary one attribute at a time, which will help isolate the iteractions between the vcgt gamma and the RGB gamma.Notes:a) The vcgt tags are "cmVideoCardGammaFormulaType", not "cmVideoCardGammaTableType". The gamma values here represent (desired gamma) / (actual gamma), so a value of 1.0 represents null (i.e. a ramp).b) The "RGB Gamma" values are rTRC, gTRC and bTRC tags, representing single gamma values according to the ICC specification (i.e. they are not LUTs).c) In all cases, the same gamma value is shared among the red, green and blue channels.d) All profiles are based on ColorMatch RGB, with modified gamma values. This is probably not important for vcgt testing, but it is good to know anyway. Here are the chromaticity coordinates of this profile:   D50 white (0.346, 0.359)         red (0.630, 0.340)       green (0.295, 0.605)        blue (0.155, 0.075)
